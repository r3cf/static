#+ATTR_HTML: :class lead
We believe that true community resilience isn't just about surviving disasters; it's about thriving daily through shared knowledge and capability.

In a digital era, we hold that neighbors who can build their own tools, maintain their own communication lines, and understand the sky above them are safer, more connected, and are more curious.

We are a *"local-first"* initiative, prioritizing technologies and skills that serve the neighborhood directly and function independently of the global grid or Internet. Our success is measured by those who we can bring along.

* Our Mission

:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: section section-alt

#+ATTR_HTML: :class lead
To equip our community to build infrastructure, communicate independently, and explore the natural world—ensuring connection and wonder. We thrive even when the lights go out.
